{"id": 522, "text": "Light and Shade by Carmen Morosan\nThere’s more to this apparently simple image than meets the eye. With the bull almost lost in shadow, and the matador bathed in sunlight, the two adversaries are linked by the strong diagonal that cuts right across the frame.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 15, "TITLE"], [19, 33, "PHOTOG"], [108, 112, "SUBJ"], [144, 151, "SUBJ"], [210, 225, "SUBJ"]]}
{"id": 523, "text": "How Hill by Geoff Tibbenham\nA lovely, tranquil image to get the week off to a relaxing start! We especially like the subtle colours of the clouds in the sky, and the sense that the water’s edge is receding into the distant haze.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 8, "TITLE"], [12, 27, "PHOTOG"], [139, 145, "SUBJ"], [153, 156, "SUBJ"], [181, 193, "SUBJ"], [215, 227, "SUBJ"]]}
{"id": 524, "text": "Toes by Noelle Buske\nThis is a great example of a tight crop taken to extremes. The soft light, the muted colours and the beautiful foreground bokeh all combine to create an image that is greater than the sum of its parts. Another wish-you-were-there gem.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 4, "TITLE"], [8, 20, "PHOTOG"]]}
{"id": 525, "text": "In the Midst of it All by Carolyn Cochrane\nHere’s a beautifully backlit image to brighten up your weekend. It’s hard to put your finger on what makes this shot so special - the composition doesn’t obey any of the ‘rules’, the background is deliberately over-exposed, and the subject is pretty everyday - but somehow it just works.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 22, "TITLE"], [26, 42, "PHOTOG"], [275, 282, "SUBJ"]]}
{"id": 526, "text": "Providence by Rob Macklin\nHow about this to welcome in the weekend? Rob’s image has a real wish-you-were-there quality, thanks to the immediacy of the flowers in the foreground, the warm light on the distant peaks, and the leading lines of the tree-clad slopes in between.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 10, "TITLE"], [14, 25, "PHOTOG"], [68, 71, "PHOTOG"], [151, 158, "SUBJ"], [200, 213, "SUBJ"], [244, 260, "SUBJ"]]}
{"id": 527, "text": "To fade in and nothing else by Sophia Alexis\nLocation portraits taken from low viewpoint, and with the foreground blurred out, seem to be all the rage at the moment, and Sophia’s image is a brilliantly executed example. With shots like this the danger is the subject getting lost in the foreground, or background, or both, but here the model’s wistful gaze is perfectly captured in the soft, early-morning light.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 27, "TITLE"], [31, 44, "PHOTOG"], [259, 266, "SUBJ"], [336, 341, "SUBJ"], [344, 356, "SUBJ"]]}

{"id": 529, "text": "Mundo azul by Luis Gonzalez\nThis stunning macro shot by Luis Gonzalez is perfectly composed and beautifully lit, but as the title suggests, it’s the muted blue colour palette of the background that really makes it.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 10, "TITLE"], [14, 27, "PHOTOG"], [56, 69, "PHOTOG"]]}
{"id": 530, "text": "Corfe Castle by Mike Byford\nHere’s something to brighten up your Monday! Corfe Castle in Dorset, UK, is a popular subject, but it’s not often you see it captured in an image as accomplished and atmospheric as this. We especially like contrast between the cool blues on the left and the warmer colours on the right.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 12, "TITLE"], [16, 27, "PHOTOG"], [73, 85, "SUBJ"], [89, 95, "LOC"], [97, 99, "LOC"]]}
{"id": 531, "text": "Rays by Marcin Sobas\nFrom bright and breezy to mean and moody. A quick glance at Marcin’s on-line portfolio (see below) shows that he is a master of mist and side-lighting, and in this stunning shot they’ve been combined to great effect.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 4, "TITLE"], [8, 20, "PHOTOG"], [81, 87, "PHOTOG"], [149, 153, "SUBJ"]]}
{"id": 532, "text": "Miri by Jack Batchelor\nWe’re often advised to avoid symmetry when photographing people, but in this breezy image by portrait specialist Jack Batchelor, positioning the model at the centre of the frame has resulted in a really striking composition. We also like the blurred flowers, the subdued colours and the deliberate vignetting in the corners, which combine to give the finished image a satisfyingly low-fi feel.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 4, "TITLE"], [8, 22, "PHOTOG"], [136, 150, "PHOTOG"], [168, 173, "SUBJ"], [265, 280, "SUBJ"]]}
{"id": 533, "text": "Cape Kiwanda by Bill Ratcliffe\nCapturing the power and energy of the sea in a still image is a real challenge, so we’re grateful to Bill Ratcliffe for showing us how it’s done…! The key to a shot like this is the timing of the exposure, and ensuring that the shutter is open as the waves are receding rather than breaking, as this creates a sense of movement as the spent waves suck back over the rocks.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 12, "TITLE"], [16, 30, "PHOTOG"], [69, 72, "SUBJ"], [132, 146, "PHOTOG"], [372, 377, "SUBJ"], [397, 402, "SUBJ"]]}
{"id": 534, "text": "Black Eyed Susan by Jacob Edmiston\nJacob’s ultra-vibrant image of a black-eyed Susan, which has to be viewed large to be fully appreciated, provides a masterclass in the use of complementary colours. The vivid yellow really stands out against the cobalt-blue of the blurred background, and this blue is echoed in the tightly-packed carpels at the centre of the flower.", "meta": {}, "annotation_approver": null, "labels": [[0, 16, "TITLE"], [20, 34, "PHOTOG"], [35, 40, "PHOTOG"], [68, 84, "SUBJ"], [317, 339, "SUBJ"], [361, 367, "SUBJ"]]}
